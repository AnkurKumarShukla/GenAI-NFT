# GenAI-NFT : Bliss


## Overview
Bliss is a revolutionary solution that ensures security and convenience coexist in Web2 and Web3 payments. Our decentralized approach eliminates the risks of compromised credentials while offering a seamless user experience. Additionally, Bliss enhances the NFT ecosystem by providing AI-driven trend analysis, price optimization, and generative NFT creation.

## Problem Statements & Solutions

### Problem 1: Identity and Card Credential Theft
Over $66B was lost between 2020 and 2023 due to compromised card credentials. Users often store card details in browsers for convenience, exposing themselves to security risks. In Web3, over $881M was lost in 2023 due to compromised private keys.

#### Solution
Bliss ensures secure transactions without storing data in centralized servers, databases, or browsers. We achieve this by:
- Minting an **in-app Stripe NFT card** that encrypts card details and stores them in **IPFS**.
- Using the **user's device as the encryption key**, ensuring that only the user can decrypt their card details.
- Employing **Thirdweb's passkey-powered smart wallet** to facilitate secure encryption/decryption on demand.
- Allowing users to securely copy-paste credentials while manually entering their CVC for added security.
- Enabling seamless **Stripe payments** without exposing card details to Web3 vulnerabilities.

This decentralized approach makes hacking nearly impossible, as the encryption key never leaves the userâ€™s device.

### Problem 2: Lack of Comprehensive NFT Tools
The NFT space consists of diverse users, including artists, marketers, economists, and finance professionals. However, no single application caters to all these user groups.

#### Solution
Bliss employs real-time **Machine Learning (ML) models** to analyze NFTs and their metadata to identify:
- **Trends** based on trade volume, price changes, and sentiment analysis.
- **Viral NFT predictions** using **Generative AI** to create high-demand NFT images.
- **SEO-optimized NFT names** and **price suggestions** to maximize earnings.

## Challenges Faced
- **AI Implementation**: Developing an effective AI model for price/name suggestion and generative NFT creation required multiple iterations and parameter tuning.
- **Thirdweb Engine Setup**: Encountered intermittent disconnections, which we mitigated through workarounds to ensure smooth application performance.

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain & Web3**: Thirdweb, IPFS, Passkeys
- **Payments**: Stripe NFT Cards
- **AI & ML**: Trend analysis, generative NFT creation
- **Frontend & Backend**: React, Node.js
